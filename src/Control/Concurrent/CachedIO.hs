-- The first time @cachedDownloadData@ is called, it calls @downloadData@,
-- stores the result, and returns it. If it is called again:
--
-- * before 10 minutes have passed, it returns the stored value.
-- * after 10 minutes have passed, it calls @downloadData@ and stores the
-- result again.
-- * @downloadData@ will not be called if a different thread is already calling it.
-- In that case, the stored value will be returned in the meantime.
