-- | Example usage:
--
-- > -- Downloads a large payload from an external data store.
-- > downloadData :: IO ByteString
-- >
-- > cachedDownloadData :: IO (Cached IO ByteString)
-- > cachedDownloadData = cachedIO (secondsToNominalDiffTime 600) downloadData
--
-- The first time @cachedDownloadData@ is called, it calls @downloadData@,
-- stores the result, and returns it. If it is called again:
--
-- * before 10 minutes have passed, it returns the stored value.
-- * after 10 minutes have passed, it calls @downloadData@ and stores the
-- result again.
