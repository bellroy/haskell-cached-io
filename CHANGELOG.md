# Revision history for cached-io

## Unreleased (patch)

- Correctly transition the internal state to `Initializing` when filling the cache for the first time.

## 1.3.0.0

- **Breaking** Caching functions previously returned `m (t a)`, but it was easy to accidentally use `join` when `m` and `t` were the same monad (eg. `IO (IO a)`), and not get any caching at all. These functions now use a `Cached` newtype for `t a` to make it more difficult to misuse.

### Migrating from <=1.2.0.0 to 1.3.0.0

```haskell
-- Previous versions
f :: IO ()
f = do
  cachedAction <- cachedIO action :: IO (IO a)
  cachedResult <- cachedAction

-- New version
f :: IO ()
f = do
  cachedAction <- cachedIO action :: IO (Cached IO a)
  cachedResult <- runCached cachedAction
```

## 1.2.0.0

Thank you [glasserc](https://github.com/glasserc) for your work on previous versions, and a special thanks to
[Arguggi](https://github.com/Arguggi) for contributing many of the improvements incorporated into this
version.

- [Bellroy](https://github.com/bellroy) is the new maintainer of this package. See https://github.com/glasserc/haskell-cached-io/pull/1.
- New `cachedIO'` and `cachedIOWith'` support generating an action depending on the most recent cached value and its timestamp, if there was one.
- `cachedIO ttl f` can now be run in a different monad to `f`. Similarly for `cachedIO'`, `cachedIOWith`, `cachedIOWith'`.
- Fixes uncaught exceptions leaving the cache in a deadlocked state and other problems.
